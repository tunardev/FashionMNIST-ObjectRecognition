# FashionMNIST Object Recognition

This repository contains a deep learning project that focuses on object recognition using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal of the project is to develop a neural network model that can accurately classify different fashion items based on their images.

## About the Project

The project is built using PyTorch and consists of the following components:

- Loading and preprocessing the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Defining a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for object recognition
- Training the model using the training dataset
- Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset
- Visualizing predictions made by the trained model
